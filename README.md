# Survivor

A bookstore system created in 2012 as a final project of Instituto TÃ©cnico de Barueri.

# How does it works?

I really don't know. It has more than 8 years dude. Remember YOU ARE A SURVIVOR.

- This project has no design pattern
- No simple structure
- No code convention rules
- Maybe it has an indentation but I really think it don't

Bonus: This application is fully invisible. All resources are just background images with invisible components above them. Enjoy the DESIGN REVOLUTION!
